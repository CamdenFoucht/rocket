# Rocket

This repo contains **Rocket**, a handwritten compiler in C# while following Immo Landwerth's [Compiler Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y). The compiler illustrates basic concepts of compiler construction and how one can tool the language inside of an IDE by exposing APIs for parsing and type checking.
